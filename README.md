*In this game the computer will start with a random number.

*There are four different color crystals on the page that the player must click in any combination they wish.

*Each crystal has a random number assigned to it that the player cannot see.

*The player's combination of clicks must add up to the random number generated by the computer in order to tally a win.

*If the players clicks add up to more than the computer number, then the player will tally a loss.

*Once a win or loss is recorded, both the computer generated, random number and the crystals' values will reset.
